# Time-Series-Forecasting-Australian-Tourism-Trips-to-Victoria-Region-
Developed and implemented forecasting models to predict the number of trips to the Victoria region in Australia based on historical data.

-Partitioned the data into a training set (1998-2014) and a validation set (2015-2017).
-Fitted a regression model with a linear trend and additive seasonality to the training data, achieving accurate forecasts.
-Utilized an ARIMA model to capture the time series patterns and determine the appropriate differencing, AR, and MA terms.
-Selected the recommended ARIMA model based on ACF and PACF plots, obtaining improved predictions.
-Explored exponential smoothing models to identify trends and seasonality in the data, recommending the most suitable ETS model.
-Conducted an automatic selection of error, trend, and seasonality structure using the ETS algorithm, enhancing forecasting accuracy.
-Assessed the predictive accuracy of all models using cross-validation, comparing their performance metrics.
-Recommended the best-performing model for forecasting trips to the Victoria region to the Australian tourism board.
-Created visualizations to showcase the model fit to the training data and forecasted values, aiding in decision-making.
-Produced a 3-year forecast and prediction interval for the chosen model based on the complete dataset.

-Skills Applied: Data analysis, time series modeling, regression analysis, ARIMA modeling, exponential smoothing, cross-validation, data visualization.
